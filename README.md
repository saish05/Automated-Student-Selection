# Predictive Analysis of Student Club Selection

This project aims to predict whether a student is likely to join and suit a particular club based on various parameters. Starting from the collection of data, every step of the project, including data preprocessing, analysis, modeling, and evaluation, was performed to demonstrate a thorough understanding of the data science lifecycle.

## Description

The project begins with the identification of parameters relevant to predicting student club selection, including branch, gender, year, CGPA, position interest, past experience, skill set, interests, and participation in other clubs.

### Steps Undertaken:

1. **Data Collection**: Data was collected through surveys and interviews, capturing relevant information about students' backgrounds and preferences. This data was then stored in a structured format using pandas DataFrame.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Several preprocessing steps were performed to clean and organize the collected data. This involved removing unwanted columns, extracting useful information from email IDs, handling missing values, removing duplicates, and filtering out invalid data.

3. **Feature Engineering**: The collected data was fine-tuned and structured to match the requirements for predictive modeling. Features like CGPA were discretized into categories to simplify analysis.

4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Exploratory data analysis techniques, such as correlation analysis and visualization, were employed to understand the relationships between different features and the target variable.

5. **Modeling**: Various machine learning models, including logistic regression, were trained on the preprocessed data to predict student club selections.

6. **Evaluation**: The performance of the trained models was evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. This step ensured that the models accurately predicted student club selections.
